\section{GPU acceleration}
The approach to accelerating the GPU version of \LSMS\ has been described in
\cite{Eisenbach2017}.

\section{Non-Spherical Potentials}
The non-spherical potential capability of LSMS is based on solving the single site scattering
problem using the phase integral technique as described for the relativistic Dirac equation
case in \cite{Liu2016}. The numerical stability problem of the irregular solution in
multiple-scattering is circumvented by calculating observables by splitting the
single scattering and multiple scattering contribution into two different integration paths
and thus avoiding the need for the irregular solution. This approach is described in \cite{Liu2018}.
